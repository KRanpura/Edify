# Edify

## Description

Edify is a web-based application designed to connect those interested in learning (mentees) with those who have a passion for teaching and discovering talent (mentors). At it's core, Edify uses algorithms in order to match mentees with mentors based on their mutual fields and interests. Edify uses chat and video call features to make connecting and communicating easy, all contained within the one application! On the more technical side, the work surrounding Edify was mainly done in Javascript, CSS, and html, supported by React.js and Next.js. The backend, responsible for storing information about users, was implemented using Firebase. Auth0 was used to provide a secure and easy login experience for users wishing to access the website.
